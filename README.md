# PanaTracker

## This is a React Native app for tracking your friends' match history in League of Legends.

### Description

> *Have you seen Ferchito's losersQueue? Absolutely hilarious, my bud is already hearing voices.* - Probably me

Have you ever wondered how was your friend's evening playing some competitive games of League of Legends? I have. So I made this app. Mostly for the chuckles and the laughs, but mostly for encouraging you homies in their grindset in this harmful enviroment.

### Overview

This React Native App uses the [Expo](https://expo.dev/) platform for running and building the project. The project pulls data from the [RiotAPI](https://developer.riotgames.com/docs/portal), and stores the names of your friends in a PostgreSQL database for future datafetching. The premise is simple:
- Login/Signup
- Add your friends by searching their Summoner's Name
- Check their progress/descention to madness
- Check can also check your progress in your profile!

### Install and Run

- Clone this repo.
- npm i this bad boi.
- You'll need the [Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/expo-cli/) for running the project.
- npm start
- With Expo you can use [your own device](https://expo.dev/client) (scanning the QR code using the app), an [Android Emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/) or an [iOS Emulator(macOS only)](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/), depending on your available hardware.
- Now you have the project running!
